        <h2>NAME</h2>

<pre><code>    fortune - print a random, hopefully interesting, adage
</code></pre>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre><code>    fortune [-a -c -f -o -s -v] [file]
</code></pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<pre><code>    When  fortune  is run with no arguments it prints out a random epigram.
    Epigrams are divided into several categories, where  each  category  is
    sub-divided  into those which are potentially offensive and those which
    are not.
</code></pre>

<h3>Options</h3>

<pre><code>    -a      Choose from all lists of maxims, both offensive and  not.
            (See the -o option for more information on offensive fortunes.)

    -c      Show the cookie file from which the fortune came.

    -f      Print out the list of files which would be searched,
            but  don't print a fortune.

    -l      Long  dictums  only.   See -n on how ``long'' is defined in this
            sense.

    -n length
            Set the longest fortune length (in characters) considered to  be
            ``short''  (the  default is 160).  All fortunes longer than this
            are considered ``long''.  Be careful!  If you set the length too
            short  and  ask for short fortunes, or too long and ask for long
            ones, fortune goes into a never-ending thrash loop.

    -o      Choose only from potentially offensive aphorisms. The -o option
            is ignored if a fortune directory is specified.

            Please,  please,  please request a potentially offensive fortune
            if and only if you believe, deep in your  heart,  that  you  are
            willing  to  be  offended.  (And  that you'll just quit using -o
            rather than give us grief about it, okay?)

            ... let us keep in mind the basic governing  philosophy  of  The
            Brotherhood, as handsomely summarized in these words: we believe
            in healthy, hearty laughter -- at the expense of the whole human
            race, if needs be.  Needs be.
                    --H. Allen Smith, "Rude Jokes"


    -s      Short  apothegms  only.  See -n on which fortunes are considered
            ``short''.
