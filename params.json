{"name":"Fortunesharp","body":"## NAME\r\n        fortune - print a random, hopefully interesting, adage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## SYNOPSIS\r\n\r\n        fortune [-a -c -f -o -s -v] [file]\r\n\r\n## DESCRIPTION\r\n        When  fortune  is run with no arguments it prints out a random epigram.\r\n        Epigrams are divided into several categories, where  each  category  is\r\n        sub-divided  into those which are potentially offensive and those which\r\n        are not.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n        -a      Choose from all lists of maxims, both offensive and  not.\r\n                (See the -o option for more information on offensive fortunes.)\r\n\r\n        -c      Show the cookie file from which the fortune came.\r\n\r\n        -f      Print out the list of files which would be searched,\r\n                but  don't print a fortune.\r\n\r\n        -l      Long  dictums  only.   See -n on how ``long'' is defined in this\r\n                sense.\r\n\r\n        -n length\r\n                Set the longest fortune length (in characters) considered to  be\r\n                ``short''  (the  default is 160).  All fortunes longer than this\r\n                are considered ``long''.  Be careful!  If you set the length too\r\n                short  and  ask for short fortunes, or too long and ask for long\r\n                ones, fortune goes into a never-ending thrash loop.\r\n\r\n        -o      Choose only from potentially offensive aphorisms. The -o option\r\n                is ignored if a fortune directory is specified.\r\n\r\n                Please,  please,  please request a potentially offensive fortune\r\n                if and only if you believe, deep in your  heart,  that  you  are\r\n                willing  to  be  offended.  (And  that you'll just quit using -o\r\n                rather than give us grief about it, okay?)\r\n\r\n                ... let us keep in mind the basic governing  philosophy  of  The\r\n                Brotherhood, as handsomely summarized in these words: we believe\r\n                in healthy, hearty laughter -- at the expense of the whole human\r\n                race, if needs be.  Needs be.\r\n                        --H. Allen Smith, \"Rude Jokes\"\r\n\r\n\r\n        -s      Short  apothegms  only.  See -n on which fortunes are considered\r\n                ``short''.\r\n\r\n        -v      Display version info\r\n\r\n        /?
